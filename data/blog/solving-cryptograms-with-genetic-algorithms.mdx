# Introduction

Encryption plays a vital role in the digital world. One of the safest ways to protect important data from prying
eyes is to encrypt it. This involves transforming each character into a completely random one, making the data
unreadable during transmission. While encryption is a complex and important aspect of cybersecurity, I would
like to delve into a specific but not so complex type; monoalphabetic substitution ciphers or better known as
cryptograms. This exploration will allow us to understand the foundations of encryption and open the door to other
fascinating concepts, such as genetic algorithms, a small subset of the field of artificial intelligence.
So let me break down these topics for you!

# Cryptogram

Let's start by defining what a cryptogram is. It is basically a puzzle in which an initially readable
text (plaintext) is encrypted by replacing each letter with a different one from the same alphabet, which is
why it is also called substitution cipher. While cryptograms may have been used in the past to hide personal
secrets or for military purposes, today they are often so easy to decipher that they are mainly printed in
newspapers and magazines for fun.

# Cipher Key

The cipher key is the most crucial concept in encryption: it is the key that gives us access to encrypt
or decrypt the cryptogram. For simple substitution ciphers, the cipher key is a text string that indicates
what letter our plaintext will be replaced with to encrypt it, or what letter our ciphertext will be replaced
with to decrypt it. In this case, the cipher key contains all the letters of the alphabet, but in random order.

To encrypt plaintext, each letter is replaced with the corresponding letter of the cipher key in the original
alphabet, such as:

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ -> Original alphabet  
DJTGIBOKWHMFYACSVRQNUZLXEP -> cipher key (alphabet with random order)

Hello World -> plaintext  
Wiffc Lcryg -> ciphertext
```
