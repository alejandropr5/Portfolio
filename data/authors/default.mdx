Hi! I'm Alejandro Perdomo. Through this portfolio I want to show you the projects
I have been working on, their creation process and maybe some interesting new concepts.

I am proficient in Python and knowledgeable in various programming languages and
database systems. My current interests are in the areas of software development,
data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, so I hope to see more
of these things in the future!

I am excited to collaborate in diverse, multidisciplinary and multicultural teams
that give the opportunity to gain knowledge and enrich the experience from diverse
perspectives. Likewise, I am pleased to offer my help and contribute my knowledge.
