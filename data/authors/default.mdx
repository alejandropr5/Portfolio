Hi! I'm Alejandro Perdomo, welcome to my blog.

I'm passionate about mathematics and problem solving, I enjoy developing creative
solutions through programming. In my free time, I 
dedicate myself to developing personal projects that explore web development,
software development, data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence,
and I share my learnings here in this blog.

I am excited to continue exploring these topics and I hope to see more of these
things in the future!
