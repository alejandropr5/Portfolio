Hi! I'm Alejandro Perdomo. Through this portfolio I want to show you the projects I have been working on, the creation process and maybe teach you some interesting new concepts.

I am proficient in Python and knowledgeable in various programming languages and database systems. My current interests are in the areas of software development, data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, so I hope to see more of these things in the future!

I am excited to collaborate in diverse, multidisciplinary and multicultural teams that give the opportunity to gain knowledge and enrich the experience from diverse perspectives. Likewise, I am pleased to offer my help and contribute my knowledge.
